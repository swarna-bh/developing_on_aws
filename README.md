Hi Devs <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tarikul-Islam-Anik/Animated-Fluent-Emojis/master/Emojis/Hand%20gestures/Hand%20with%20Fingers%20Splayed%20Light%20Skin%20Tone.png" alt="Hand with Fingers Splayed Light Skin Tone" width="25" height="25" />

AWS is my passion. And developing on AWS is what I love.
I keep on developing small and large dev projects on AWS and upload the Terraform and Ansible code in this repo.

Feel free to use my source codes to build your projects on AWS at any time.

Happy learning!<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tarikul-Islam-Anik/Animated-Fluent-Emojis/master/Emojis/Smilies/Beating%20Heart.png" alt="Beating Heart" width="25" height="25" />
